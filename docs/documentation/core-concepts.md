# Core Concepts

The Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) is an open standard for interoperability
between commerce entities. It defines a common language and functional primitives
so that clients and providers can interoperate securely and reliably across
commercial verticals.

This document provides the detailed technical specification for UCP.
For a complete definition of all data models and schemas, see the
[Schema Reference](../specification/reference.md).

!!! note "Terminology"
    Throughout this documentation, **Client** refers to any entity that *consumes*
    capabilities — an app, an AI agent, a procurement system, or another business.
    **Provider** refers to any entity that *exposes* capabilities — a retailer, a
    supplier, a service provider, or any other participant offering commerce
    functionality. These roles are defined by direction of capability flow, not by
    industry vertical, making UCP equally applicable to B2C, B2B, and agent-to-agent
    commerce. The terms *platform* and *business* may appear in earlier drafts and
    community discussions — they are synonymous with Client and Provider respectively.

Its primary goal is to enable:

* **Clients:** To dynamically discover and consume the capabilities a provider exposes.
* **Providers:** To declare what they offer and how they operate — once — and have any compatible client discover and use it without bespoke integrations.
* **Payment & Credential Providers:** To securely hold sensitive user data and issue tokens or credentials on behalf of users, so that clients and providers never handle sensitive payment or identity information directly.

## Key Goals of UCP

* **Interoperability:** Bridge the gap between clients, providers,
    and payment ecosystems.
* **Discovery:** Allow clients to dynamically discover what
    capabilities a provider supports (e.g., "Do they support checkout?", "Do they
    support fulfillment options or identity linking?").
* **Security:** Facilitate secure, standards-based (OAuth 2.0, PCI-DSS
    compliant patterns) exchanges of sensitive user and payment data.
* **Agentic Commerce:** Enable AI agents to act on behalf of any principals
    (an individual, organization, or another agent) and support different
    modalities (human-in-the-loop, fully autonomous).

## Roles & Participants

UCP defines the interactions between four distinct actors, each playing
a specific role in the commerce lifecycle.

### Client

The client is any entity that consumes capabilities exposed by a provider —
an AI agent, a mobile app, a procurement system, or another business acting
as a capability consumer. It orchestrates the interaction by discovering what
the provider supports and invoking the appropriate capabilities on behalf of
its principal (a user, an automated process, or another system).

* **Responsibilities:** Discovering provider capabilities via profiles,
    initiating and managing capability sessions, and acting on behalf of its
    principal within the bounds of negotiated capabilities.
* **Examples:** AI Shopping Assistants, Super Apps, Search Engines, B2B Procurement Systems.

### Provider

The entity exposing capabilities. In transactional contexts, provider typically
acts as the **Merchant of Record (MoR)**, retaining financial liability
and ownership of the transaction — though UCP's capability model is not limited
to transactional use cases.

* **Responsibilities:** Publishing a UCP profile, declaring supported
    services, capabilities and extensions, processing capability invocations which may be stateful or stateless.
* **Examples:** Retailers, Airlines, Hotel Chains, Service Providers, Suppliers, Distributors.

### Credential Provider (CP)

A trusted entity responsible for securely managing and sharing sensitive user
data, particularly payment instruments and shipping addresses.

* **Responsibilities:** Authenticating the user, issuing payment tokens (to
    keep raw card data off the client), and holding PII securely to minimize
    compliance scope for other parties.
* **Examples:** Digital Wallets (e.g., Google Wallet, Apple Pay), Identity
    Providers.

### Payment Service Provider (PSP)

The financial infrastructure provider that processes payments on behalf of
businesses.

* **Responsibilities:** Authorizing and capturing transactions, handling
    settlements, and communicating with card networks. The PSP often interacts
    directly with tokens provided by the Credential Provider.
* **Examples:** Stripe, Adyen, PayPal, Braintree, Chase Paymentech.

## Core Concepts Summary

UCP revolves around three fundamental constructs that define how entities
interact.

### Capabilities

Capabilities are standalone, independently versioned features that
a business declares it supports. They are the "verbs" of the protocol —
discrete units of functionality that clients can discover, negotiate, and
invoke.

Each capability is identified by a reverse-domain name (e.g.,
`dev.ucp.shopping.checkout`) and carries a date-based version. Capabilities
are declared in the provider's UCP profile at `/.well-known/ucp` and
negotiated and confirmed in every response so that the client always knows
the active feature set for a given interaction.

The following are examples of capabilities defined in UCP — see the [Specification](../specification/overview.md) for the authoritative and up-to-date list.

| Capability | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout` | Core | Initiates and completes purchase sessions |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.cart` | Core | Pre-checkout cart management |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.catalog.search` | Core | Search across a business catalog |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.catalog.lookup` | Core | Retrieve a specific product by ID |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.order` | Core (webhook) | Order lifecycle events |
| `dev.ucp.common.identity_linking` | Common | OAuth-based account linking |

### Extensions

Extensions optionally augment a base capability. They use the
`extends` field to declare their parent(s) and compose onto the base schema
using JSON Schema `allOf`. Extensions appear in `ucp.capabilities[]` alongside
core capabilities.

```json
{
  "dev.ucp.shopping.fulfillment": [
    {
      "version": "2026-01-23",
      "extends": "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout",
      "spec": "https://ucp.dev/2026-01-23/specification/fulfillment",
      "schema": "https://ucp.dev/2026-01-23/schemas/shopping/fulfillment.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

An extension that declares `extends` without its parent in the negotiated
intersection is automatically pruned. This ensures extension coherence —
you never activate a discount extension without the checkout it extends.

The following are examples of extensions defined in UCP — see the [Specification](../specification/overview.md) for the authoritative and up-to-date list.

| Extension | Extends | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.discount` | checkout, cart | Discount codes and promotions |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.fulfillment` | checkout | Shipping and delivery options |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.ap2_mandate` | checkout | Non-repudiable authorization for autonomous commerce |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.buyer_consent` | checkout | Explicit consent capture |

### Services

**Services** group the operations and events for a vertical under a
reverse-domain namespace (e.g., `dev.ucp.shopping`).
A service declares *what* functionality exists for that vertical; transport
bindings declare *how* it is accessed on the wire.

A single service can be accessed via multiple transport bindings:

| Transport | Format | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **REST** | OpenAPI 3.1.0 | Standard server-to-server integrations |
| **MCP** | OpenRPC | AI agents via Model Context Protocol |
| **A2A** | Agent Card | Agent-to-Agent protocol integrations |
| **Embedded** | OpenRPC | Embedded integrations |

A provider declares which transport bindings it supports within each service;
clients pick whichever fits their context — an AI agent may prefer MCP, a
traditional web app may use REST.

Service namespaces are also UCP's extensibility mechanism for new verticals — e.g.,
`dev.ucp.hotels` may be introduced in the future. Businesses opt in by declaring which
services they support.

## Discovery & Capability Negotiation

UCP uses a profile-based discovery model. Every provider publishes a machine-readable
profile at `/.well-known/ucp` that declares which services, capabilities, and
payment handlers they support. Clients advertise their own profile URL on each
request via the `UCP-Agent` header.

```text
POST /checkout-sessions HTTP/1.1
UCP-Agent: profile="https://agent.example/profiles/shopping-agent.json"
```

This design enables **permissionless onboarding** — any client with a
discoverable profile can interact with any provider without prior registration.
Providers may additionally establish trust with known clients through
out-of-band onboarding & verification mechanisms (API keys, OAuth credentials, mTLS certificates).

### Capability Intersection

Capability negotiation follows a **server-selects** architecture. The provider
determines the active capabilities by computing the intersection of its own
declared capabilities with those in the client's profile:

1. **Intersect by name** — Only capabilities both parties declare are candidates.
2. **Select version** — For each matched capability, compute the set of versions
   present in both the provider and client arrays. Select the highest (latest
   date). If no mutual version exists, exclude the capability.
3. **Prune orphaned extensions** — Extensions whose parent capability is not in
   the intersection are removed. Pruning repeats until stable (handles chains).

The result is a minimal, mutually compatible capability set. Providers include
the active capabilities in every response so clients always know which features
apply to a given interaction.

### Profile Structure

Both provider and client profiles share a common base structure — a `ucp`
object declaring protocol version, services, capabilities, and payment handlers,
alongside a `signing_keys` array of JWK public keys. The `ucp` object differs
between the two: the provider profile uses a provider-specific schema (hosted at
`/.well-known/ucp`), while the client profile uses a client-specific schema
(hosted at a URI the client advertises per-request). This dual-purpose profile
— capabilities *and* keys in a single document — means discovery and
authentication are resolved together.

```json
{
  "ucp": {
    "version": "2026-01-23",
    "services": {
      "dev.ucp.shopping": [
        {
          "version": "2026-01-23",
          "spec": "https://ucp.dev/2026-01-23/specification/overview",
          "transport": "rest",
          "schema": "https://ucp.dev/2026-01-23/services/shopping/rest.openapi.json",
          "endpoint": "https://business.example.com/ucp/v1"
        }
      ]
    },
    "capabilities": {
      "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout": [{
        "version": "2026-01-23",
        "spec": "https://ucp.dev/2026-01-23/specification/checkout",
        "schema": "https://ucp.dev/2026-01-23/schemas/shopping/checkout.json"
      }],
      "dev.ucp.shopping.fulfillment": [{
        "version": "2026-01-23",
        "spec": "https://ucp.dev/2026-01-23/specification/fulfillment",
        "schema": "https://ucp.dev/2026-01-23/schemas/shopping/fulfillment.json",
        "extends": "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout"
      }]
    },
    "payment_handlers": {
      "com.example.processor_tokenizer": [{
        "id": "processor_tokenizer",
        "version": "2026-01-23",
        "spec": "https://example.com/specs/payments/processor_tokenizer",
        "schema": "https://example.com/specs/payments/merchant_tokenizer.json"
      }]
    }
  },
  "signing_keys": [{ "kid": "key_2026", "kty": "EC", "crv": "P-256", "alg": "ES256" }]
}
```

## Namespace Governance

UCP uses reverse-domain naming to embed governance authority directly into
capability and service identifiers. This eliminates the need for a central
registry — domain owners control their own namespace.

```text
{reverse-domain}.{service}.{capability}
```

| Name | Authority | Who governs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout` | ucp.dev | UCP governing body |
| `com.shopify.catalog` | shopify.com | Shopify |
| `com.example.payments.installments` | example.com | example.com |

The `spec` and `schema` URLs declared in a capability must originate from the
namespace authority domain. Clients **MUST** validate this binding to prevent
spoofed capabilities.

The `dev.ucp.*` namespace is reserved exclusively for capabilities governed by
the UCP Tech Council. Any vendor can define and publish capabilities under their
own domain — `org.acme.*` — without UCP maintainer approval. Vendor
capabilities follow the same extension model, meaning they can extend UCP base
capabilities (e.g., `org.acme.loyalty` extending `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout`)
or define entirely new ones. Because negotiation is always opt-in, vendor
capabilities only activate when both parties declare them, keeping the protocol
decentralized by design.

## Payment Architecture

UCP decouples payment instrument acceptance from payment processing to solve
the N-to-N complexity problem between clients, providers, and payment
processors.

### The Trust Triangle

The payment model is built on three bilateral trust relationships:

1. **Provider ↔ Payment Service Provider (PSP)** — Pre-existing legal and
   technical relationship; the provider holds API keys and contracts with its PSP.
2. **Client ↔ Credential Provider (CP)** — The client acquires a payment
   instrument (token, encrypted payload) directly from the CP, keeping raw
   credentials off the client-to-provider API.
3. **Client ↔ Provider** — The client submits the opaque token to the
   provider, which processes it via its backend PSP integration.

Credentials flow **client → provider** only; providers **MUST NOT** echo
credentials back in responses.

### Payment Handlers

Payment Handlers are **specifications**, not entities. They define how a
particular payment instrument is acquired and processed. The distinction:

* **Credential Provider (CP) / PSP** — The participant(s) that issue tokens and
  process payments. Depending on the handler, these may be the same entity or
  separate ones (e.g., Google Pay tokenizes; the business's PSP processes).
* **Payment Handler** — The specification that defines the protocol
  (e.g., `com.google.pay`, `dev.shopify.shop_pay`)

The 3-step payment lifecycle:

1. **Negotiation** — The business advertises available payment handlers in its
   profile and checkout response based on contents and negotiated
   properties of the checkout.
2. **Acquisition** — The client executes the handler's logic to acquire a
   payment instrument (token or encrypted payload) directly from the CP.
3. **Completion** — The client submits the instrument to the provider, which
   charges funds via its PSP integration.

This architecture keeps raw card data off the client-to-provider API,
minimizing PCI scope for the client and reducing compliance surface for the
overall integration.

## Security & Authentication

### Identity & Key Discovery

UCP profiles serve a dual purpose: declaring capabilities **and** publishing
signing keys. Both parties resolve keys from the same profile document used for
capability negotiation, eliminating a separate key management step.

Key lookup:

1. Obtain the signer's profile URL (from `UCP-Agent` header or `/.well-known/ucp`).
2. Fetch and cache the profile.
3. Match the `keyid` from `Signature-Input` to a `kid` in `signing_keys[]`.
4. Verify the signature using the corresponding public key.

### Authentication Mechanisms

UCP supports multiple authentication models:

| Mechanism | Onboarding | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HTTP Message Signatures** ([RFC 9421](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421)) | Permissionless | Keys discovered from profile; no prior exchange needed |
| **OAuth 2.0** | Pre-established | Client credentials or authorization code |
| **API Keys** | Pre-established | Pre-shared secrets exchanged out-of-band |
| **mTLS** | Pre-established | Mutual TLS with client certificates |

Provider-to-client webhooks **MUST** be signed. HTTP Message Signatures are
the only mechanism that enables a client to interact with a provider without
prior credential exchange.

### Identity Linking

The `dev.ucp.common.identity_linking` capability enables a client to obtain
OAuth 2.0 authorization to act on behalf of a user at a provider — unlocking
loyalty benefits, personalized offers, wishlists, and authenticated checkouts.
Providers publish their OAuth 2.0 server metadata at
`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`.

## Versioning

UCP uses date-based version identifiers (`YYYY-MM-DD`). The version represents
the date of the last backwards-incompatible change.

* **Non-breaking additions** do not increment the date.
* **Breaking changes** require a `!` prefix in the PR title and a 2-week
  advance notice to the community before merging.
* Providers that support older protocol versions **SHOULD** publish
  version-specific profiles and advertise them via the `supported_versions`
  field in their profile, enabling clients to discover the exact capability
  set for each supported version.

Capability schemas carry their version inline, which enables independent
versioning — a discount extension can version on a different cadence than
the checkout capability it extends.
