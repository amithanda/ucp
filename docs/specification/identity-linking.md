# Identity Linking Capability

* **Capability Name:** `dev.ucp.common.identity_linking`
* **Schema:** `https://ucp.dev/schemas/common/identity_linking.json`

## Overview

The Identity Linking capability enables a **platform** to obtain authorization
to perform actions on behalf of a **user** on a **business**'s (relying
party) site.

This linkage is foundational for user-authenticated commerce experiences: accessing
loyalty benefits, personalized offers, saved addresses, wishlists, and order
history. Capabilities without identity linking still operate at public or
agent-authenticated access levels — identity linking upgrades the experience,
it does not gate it.

**This specification uses
[OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749){ target="_blank" }**
as the v1 auth mechanism. The schema is designed for incremental extension:
future versions will add delegated identity provider support and non-OAuth
authentication mechanisms — both via a single `config.providers` extension
point — without breaking changes to this version (see
[Future Extensibility](#future-extensibility)).

### Participants

| UCP Role | Identity Role | Description |
| :------- | :------------ | :---------- |
| **Platform** | User Agent | Trusted intermediary that initiates identity linking and presents user identity tokens to businesses on behalf of the user. |
| **Business** | Authorization Server / Relying Party | Hosts its own OAuth 2.0 authorization server. Authenticates users and issues access tokens scoped to UCP capabilities. |
| **User** | Resource Owner | The person whose identity is being linked. Grants explicit consent to the platform during the OAuth authorization flow. |

### Access Levels

Capabilities operate at three access levels:

| Level | Authentication | Example |
| :---- | :------------- | :------ |
| **Public** | None | Browse a public catalog |
| **Agent-authenticated** | Platform credentials (`client_id` / `client_secret`) | Guest checkout, create a cart |
| **User-authenticated** | Platform credentials + user identity token | Saved addresses, full order history, personalized pricing |

Identity linking bridges agent-authenticated to user-authenticated access: the
platform obtains a user identity token by completing the OAuth flow described
below, and presents it on subsequent requests.

**Identity linking and capability negotiation are independent layers.** A
capability is advertised and negotiated based on its own profile presence —
never excluded because identity linking is absent. Identity linking, when
present, declares the **scopes** that gate user-authenticated operations
*within* negotiated capabilities (see [Scopes](#scopes)). A merchant whose
profile lists `dev.ucp.shopping.order` has it in the negotiated intersection
either way. If their profile *also* lists identity linking with
`dev.ucp.shopping.order:read` in `config.scopes`, operations covered by
that scope require a user identity token.

## General Guidelines

### For Platforms

* **MUST** authenticate using `client_id` and `client_secret`
    ([RFC 6749 §2.3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1){ target="_blank" })
    via HTTP Basic Authentication
    ([RFC 7617](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617){ target="_blank" })
    when exchanging authorization codes for tokens.
* **MUST** include user identity tokens in the HTTP `Authorization` header
    using the Bearer scheme: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
* When the platform authentication mechanism uses the `Authorization` header
    for platform credentials (e.g., OAuth 2.0 Bearer), platforms **MUST**
    carry the user identity token in the `UCP-Identity-Token` header instead.
    For all other UCP-supported platform authentication mechanisms — API keys,
    mTLS, and HTTP Message Signatures — the `Authorization` header is available
    for the user identity token and `Authorization: Bearer <user_token>` applies
    as specified above.
* **MUST** implement the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow
    ([RFC 6749 §4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1){ target="_blank" })
    as the account linking mechanism.
* **MUST** use PKCE
    ([RFC 7636](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636){ target="_blank" })
    with `code_challenge_method=S256` for all authorization code exchanges.
* **MUST** validate the `iss` parameter in the authorization response
    ([RFC 9207](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207){ target="_blank" })
    to prevent Mix-Up Attacks. The platform **MUST** verify that the `iss`
    value matches the authorization server's issuer URI (as declared in its
    [RFC 8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414){ target="_blank" }
    metadata). If the values do not match, the platform **MUST**
    abort and discard the authorization response.
* **SHOULD** include a unique, unguessable `state` parameter in the
    authorization request to prevent CSRF
    ([RFC 6749 §10.12](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-10.12){ target="_blank" }).
* Revocation and security events:
    * **MUST** call the business's token revocation endpoint
        ([RFC 7009](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009){ target="_blank" })
        when a user initiates an unlink action on the platform side.
    * **SHOULD** support
        [OpenID RISC Profile 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-risc-1_0-final.html){ target="_blank" }
        to handle asynchronous account updates and cross-account protection
        events initiated by the business.

### For Businesses

* **MUST** implement OAuth 2.0
    ([RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749){ target="_blank" }).
* **MUST** publish authorization server metadata via
    [RFC 8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414){ target="_blank" }
    at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`.
* **MUST** populate `scopes_supported` in
    [RFC 8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414){ target="_blank" }
    metadata to allow platforms
    to detect scope mismatches before initiating an authorization flow.
* **MUST** return the `iss` parameter in the authorization response
    ([RFC 9207](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207){ target="_blank" }).
* **MUST** enforce PKCE
    ([RFC 7636](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636){ target="_blank" })
    validation at the token endpoint for all authorization code exchanges.
    Requests without a valid `code_verifier` **MUST** be rejected.
* **MUST** enforce exact string matching for the `redirect_uri` parameter
    during authorization requests to prevent open redirects and token theft.
    The `redirect_uri` in the token request **MUST** be identical to the one
    in the authorization request.
* **MUST** enforce client authentication at the token endpoint.
* **MUST** validate user identity tokens on every user-authenticated request:
    verify `iss`, `aud` (the business's resource server identifier), `exp`,
    scopes, and `client_id` / `azp` (or equivalent) to confirm the token was
    issued to the authenticated platform client
    ([RFC 9068 §4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9068#section-4){ target="_blank" }).
* **MUST** accept the user identity token from the `UCP-Identity-Token` header
    when the `Authorization` header is present with platform credentials.
* **MUST** implement token revocation
    ([RFC 7009](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009){ target="_blank" }).
    Revoking a `refresh_token` **MUST** also immediately invalidate all
    `access_token`s issued from it.
* **MUST** support revocation requests authenticated with the same client
    credentials used at the token endpoint.
* **SHOULD** provide an account creation flow if the user does not already have
    an account, or return a `continue_url` in an `identity_required` error
    response (see [Error Handling](#error-handling)) pointing to an onboarding
    flow.
* **MUST** support standard UCP scopes as defined in the
    [Scopes](#scopes) section.
* **SHOULD** implement
    [RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728/){ target="_blank" }
    (HTTP Resource Metadata) to allow platforms to discover the authorization
    server associated with specific resources.
* **SHOULD** support
    [OpenID RISC Profile 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-risc-1_0-final.html){ target="_blank" }
    to signal revocation and account state changes to platforms.

## Discovery

Platforms resolve business authorization server metadata using the following
**strict two-tier hierarchy**. The issuer URI used as the discovery base is
the business's domain as declared in its UCP profile.

1. **RFC 8414 (Primary):** Fetch
   `{business-domain}/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`.
    * `2xx` response: use this metadata. Discovery complete.
    * `404 Not Found`: proceed to step 2.
    * Any other non-2xx response, network error, or timeout: **MUST** abort.
      **MUST NOT** proceed to step 2.

2. **OIDC Discovery (Fallback):** Fetch
   `{business-domain}/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
    * `2xx` response: use this metadata. Discovery complete.
    * Any non-2xx response, network error, or timeout: **MUST** abort the
      identity linking process.

Platforms **MUST NOT** silently fall through on any error other than `404` in
step 1. This prevents partial or undefined behavior when a server is
misconfigured or temporarily unavailable.

The `issuer` value in the discovered metadata **MUST** match the discovery
base URI exactly (per
[RFC 8414 §3.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414#section-3.3){ target="_blank" }).
Platforms **MUST NOT** normalize (e.g., strip trailing slashes) before
comparison — the value must be a byte-for-byte match.

## Account Linking Flow

Identity linking uses the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with PKCE.

   |  Validate: state matches, iss matches |
   |  discovered issuer URI                |
   |                                       |
   |-- (4) Token Request ----------------->|
   |       grant_type=authorization_code   |

   |       client_id (Basic Auth)          |
   |                                       |
   |<-- (5) Token Response ----------------|
   |       access_token, refresh_token     |
   |       token_type=Bearer, scope        |
```

**Step 2 — Scope set:** Platforms derive the authorization scope set from the
business's `config.scopes` map (see [Scope Derivation](#scope-derivation)).
Platforms **MUST** request only the derived scope set — not a superset.

**Step 3 — Validation:** The platform **MUST** verify that the `state`
parameter matches the value sent in step 2, and that the `iss` parameter
matches the authorization server's `issuer` URI from discovered metadata.
If either check fails, the platform **MUST** discard the authorization
response.

**Step 4 — PKCE:** The `code_verifier` **MUST** correspond to the
`code_challenge` sent in step 2. Businesses **MUST** reject token requests
where `code_verifier` is absent or does not verify against the stored
`code_challenge`.

## Scopes

Scopes define the user-authenticated permissions a business grants to a
platform. Businesses declare the scopes they offer in `config.scopes` of their
`dev.ucp.common.identity_linking` entry. Each key is the OAuth scope string as
it appears on the wire (`{capability}:{scope}`, e.g.
`dev.ucp.shopping.order:read`); each value is a per-scope policy object.

Listing a scope in `config.scopes` declares that obtaining that scope requires
user authentication. Operations not gated by any listed scope operate at
public or agent-authenticated access.

### Scope Token Format

Scope tokens follow the convention `{capability-name}:{scope-name}`:

* `dev.ucp.shopping.order:read`
* `dev.ucp.shopping.order:manage`
* `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout:create`

The capability name uses UCP's reverse-DNS naming. The scope name denotes
the **permission** being granted — typically an operation group on a
resource (`read`, `manage`, `write`) or an entry-point operation (`create`)
defined by each capability's specification.

Scope names **MUST** match the pattern `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`. Third-party
capabilities follow the same convention using their own reverse-DNS name:
`com.example.loyalty:points`.

### Per-Scope Policy and Metadata

Each scope's value is an open object that carries per-scope policy and
metadata. Empty `{}` means "user auth required, nothing else." Possible
fields include authentication constraints (`min_acr`, `max_token_age`,
`require_mfa`), declarative metadata (`claims` produced when granted,
human-readable consent descriptions), or other scope-specific configuration.
Platforms **MUST** ignore unrecognized fields.

### Scope Derivation

Platforms derive the authorization scope set from the business's
`config.scopes` before initiating the account linking flow:

1. Read `config.scopes` from the business's `dev.ucp.common.identity_linking`
   capability entry.
2. Filter to scopes whose capability prefix is in the negotiated capability
   set — ignore scopes for capabilities the platform does not support.
3. From the remaining set, select the scopes the platform intends to use
   (informed by which operations it plans to call; see each capability's spec
   for operation-to-scope mappings).
4. Apply the per-scope policy on each selected scope when constructing the
   authorization request.

If no scope is required for the operations the platform intends to call, the
platform can skip the identity linking flow — operations work with public or
agent-authenticated access. However, linking may still be beneficial to
unlock session-native personalization (saved addresses, member pricing, order
history visibility, etc.); the merchant resolves these from the authenticated
user context regardless of which scopes were granted.

### Consent Presentation

Consent screens are rendered by the business's authorization server. This
specification does not define scope description strings — the authorization
server is responsible for presenting human-readable consent text for the
scopes it supports. Consent screens **SHOULD** group related scopes
intelligibly rather than listing individual operations: for example, "Allow
[platform] to view your order history" rather than "grant
`dev.ucp.shopping.order:read`."

## Error Handling

### `identity_required`

When an operation is gated by a scope listed in `config.scopes` and the
request arrives with an absent, expired, invalid, or unverifiable user identity
token, the business **MUST** return a UCP error response containing a message
with `code: "identity_required"`.

The business **MAY** include a `continue_url` in the response body, pointing to
a URL where the user can complete account creation or onboarding (e.g., terms
acceptance). After the user completes the onboarding flow, the platform retries
account linking.

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "error",
      "code": "identity_required",
      "content": "User identity is required to access order history.",
      "severity": "requires_buyer_review"
    }
  ],
  "continue_url": "https://merchant.example.com/onboarding?return_to=..."
}
```

### `insufficient_scope`

When a request arrives with a valid user identity token but the token lacks a
scope required by the operation (or fails a scope-level policy such as
`min_acr` or `max_token_age`), the business **MUST** return a UCP error
response containing a message with `code: "insufficient_scope"`. The message
`content` **MUST** identify the missing scope(s) by name so the platform can
construct a targeted incremental authorization request. When performing a
scope-bump, businesses **MUST** issue the new token with a scope set that is a
superset of the user's previously granted scopes to avoid accidental scope
regressions.

The business **MAY** include a `continue_url` pointing to the authorization
endpoint pre-populated for the missing scope(s), so the platform can redirect
the user directly to re-consent.

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "error",
      "code": "insufficient_scope",
      "content": "Token is missing required scope: dev.ucp.shopping.order:manage",
      "severity": "requires_buyer_review"
    }
  ],
  "continue_url": "https://merchant.example.com/auth?scope=dev.ucp.shopping.order%3Amanage&..."
}
```

> **Note:** `identity_required` and `insufficient_scope` are intentionally
> distinct. Platforms **MUST NOT** retry an `insufficient_scope` response by
> re-initiating a fresh account linking flow — they **MUST** instead request
> only the missing scope(s) via incremental authorization to preserve
> previously granted scopes.

## Security Considerations

* **PKCE.** PKCE (`S256`) is REQUIRED for all authorization code flows.
  Plain PKCE (`plain`) **MUST NOT** be used. Businesses **MUST** reject
  authorization code exchanges without a valid `code_verifier`.
* **Mix-Up Attack prevention.** Platforms **MUST** validate the `iss`
  parameter in the authorization response
  ([RFC 9207](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207){ target="_blank" }).
  Businesses **MUST**
  return `iss` in every authorization response. Without `iss` validation,
  an attacker that controls one authorization server can redirect a
  victim's authorization code to a different server.
* **`redirect_uri` exactness.** Businesses **MUST** enforce exact string
  matching for `redirect_uri`. Partial-match or prefix-match implementations
  are a common source of open redirect and token theft vulnerabilities.
* **`issuer` exactness.** The `issuer` value in RFC 8414 metadata and the
  `iss` parameter in authorization responses **MUST** be identical
  (byte-for-byte). Platforms **MUST NOT** normalize before comparison.
  Normalization (e.g., stripping trailing slashes) is a known source of
  `iss` validation bypass.
* **Transport security.** All communication between platform and business
  **MUST** use HTTPS with a minimum of TLS 1.2
  ([RFC 6749 §1.6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.6){ target="_blank" }).
* **`scopes_supported`.** Businesses **MUST** populate `scopes_supported` in
  RFC 8414 metadata. Platforms **SHOULD** verify that the derived scope set is
  a subset of `scopes_supported` before initiating the authorization flow, to
  fail fast on scope mismatches rather than at the consent screen.
* **Token revocation.** Platforms **MUST** revoke user identity tokens at the
  business's revocation endpoint (RFC 7009) when a user unlinks their account.
  Businesses **MUST** reject subsequent requests that present revoked tokens.

## Future Extensibility

This specification intentionally scopes v1 to business-hosted OAuth 2.0.
The schema and protocol are designed to accommodate additional auth patterns
as non-breaking extensions in future versions:

### Delegated Identity Providers and Mechanism Extensibility (`config.providers`)

A future version will allow businesses to declare trusted identity providers in
a `config.providers` map, keyed by reverse-domain identifier. Each entry carries
a `type` discriminator that defaults to `oauth2`, making this a single extension
point for both delegated OAuth IdPs and future non-OAuth mechanisms such as
wallet attestation or verifiable credentials.

For delegated OAuth IdPs (e.g., `com.google`, `com.shopify`): platforms that
have already established an OAuth session with a trusted provider can present a
JWT-based authorization grant to the business's token endpoint instead of
initiating a new browser-based OAuth flow — useful for multi-merchant agentic
commerce where N merchants should not require N separate consent screens.

For non-OAuth mechanisms: entries with a non-`oauth2` `type` value enable
wallet attestation and similar schemes. Platforms select the first entry whose
`type` they support, using business-preference ordering — analogous to TLS
cipher suite negotiation.

When `config.providers` is present, the platform uses the provider selection
and identity chaining flows defined in that version. When `config.providers` is
absent (as in v1), platforms **MUST** fall back to direct OAuth 2.0 against the
business domain via RFC 8414 discovery.

**Forward-compatibility rule for platforms:** When `config` contains fields
not defined in this version of the spec (`providers` or any other future field),
platforms **MUST** ignore those fields and proceed using OAuth 2.0 with RFC 8414
discovery on the business domain, as defined here. This ensures v1 platform
implementations remain valid as the spec evolves.

## Examples

### Authorization Server Metadata

Example metadata hosted at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` per
[RFC 8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414){ target="_blank" }:

```json
{
  "issuer": "https://merchant.example.com",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://merchant.example.com/oauth2/authorize",
  "token_endpoint": "https://merchant.example.com/oauth2/token",
  "revocation_endpoint": "https://merchant.example.com/oauth2/revoke",
  "jwks_uri": "https://merchant.example.com/oauth2/jwks",
  "scopes_supported": [
    "dev.ucp.shopping.order:read",
    "dev.ucp.shopping.order:manage"
  ],
  "response_types_supported": ["code"],
  "grant_types_supported": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
  "code_challenge_methods_supported": ["S256"],
  "token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported": ["client_secret_basic"],
  "authorization_response_iss_parameter_supported": true,
  "service_documentation": "https://merchant.example.com/docs/oauth2"
}
```

Note: `authorization_response_iss_parameter_supported: true` advertises
[RFC 9207](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207){ target="_blank" } support. `code_challenge_methods_supported: ["S256"]` signals PKCE.
Both **MUST** be present in UCP-compliant metadata.

### Business Profile (`/.well-known/ucp`)

The shape of `config.scopes` reflects the business's policy.

#### B2C retailer

Public catalog, guest checkout (no scope required), user-bound order
operations gated:

```json
{
  "ucp": {
    "capabilities": {
      "dev.ucp.common.identity_linking": [{
        "version": "Working Draft",
        "spec": "https://ucp.dev/specification/identity-linking",
        "schema": "https://ucp.dev/schemas/common/identity_linking.json",
        "config": {
          "scopes": {
            "dev.ucp.shopping.order:read":    {},
            "dev.ucp.shopping.order:manage":  {}
          }
        }
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

**Reading this config:**

* `dev.ucp.shopping.order:read` and `:manage` — listed → user auth required
  to obtain.
* Catalog, checkout, cart, and everything else — not listed → no user-auth
  scope required. Public/agent-authenticated access. The user may still
  request, or the agent may still offer, linking to access additional
  capabilities such as personalization, saved addresses and credentials,
  loyalty pricing, etc.

#### B2B wholesaler

No guest checkout — every transaction requires an authenticated user:

```json
{
  "ucp": {
    "capabilities": {
      "dev.ucp.common.identity_linking": [{
        "version": "Working Draft",
        "spec": "https://ucp.dev/specification/identity-linking",
        "schema": "https://ucp.dev/schemas/common/identity_linking.json",
        "config": {
          "scopes": {
            "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout:create":  {},
            "dev.ucp.shopping.order:read":       {},
            "dev.ucp.shopping.order:manage":     {}
          }
        }
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

**The difference:** `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout:create` is now listed. The
B2C example doesn't gate checkout creation; anyone can start a guest
session. This merchant requires the user to be authenticated before
creating a checkout. Subsequent operations on that session (update,
complete, cancel) are session-bound and require no additional scope.

Whether the user is B2B-eligible, what pricing they see, what payment terms
apply — those are user attributes the merchant resolves at runtime, not
additional scopes.

### End-to-End Walkthrough

**Setup:** Platform (AI shopping agent) + Business (B2C retailer from the
example above).

**Negotiated capabilities:** `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout`,
`dev.ucp.shopping.order`, `dev.ucp.common.identity_linking`.

**Step 1 — Scope derivation.** Platform reads business's `config.scopes`:

* `dev.ucp.shopping.order:read` (read order history)
* `dev.ucp.shopping.order:manage` (cancel/return)

The user wants the agent to be able to read order history and cancel orders
on their behalf, so the platform requests both scopes.

Derived scope set: `dev.ucp.shopping.order:read dev.ucp.shopping.order:manage`

**Step 2 — Discovery.** Platform fetches
`https://merchant.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`,
receives `2xx`, extracts `authorization_endpoint` and `token_endpoint`.
Verifies both scopes are in `scopes_supported`.

**Step 3 — Authorization request.** Platform generates PKCE pair
(`code_verifier`, `code_challenge`), sends the user to:

```text
GET https://merchant.example.com/oauth2/authorize
  ?response_type=code
  &client_id=platform-client-id
  &redirect_uri=https://agent.example.com/callback
  &scope=dev.ucp.shopping.order:read dev.ucp.shopping.order:manage
  &code_challenge=<S256-hash>
  &code_challenge_method=S256
  &state=<random>
```

Reserved characters in `redirect_uri` and `:` in scope tokens must be
percent-encoded in the actual request; they are shown decoded here for readability.

**Step 4 — Authorization response.** User authenticates and consents.
Business redirects to:

```text
https://agent.example.com/callback
  ?code=<auth-code>
  &state=<random>
  &iss=https://merchant.example.com
```

Platform validates `state` matches and `iss` equals the discovered `issuer`.

**Step 5 — Token exchange.** Platform calls token endpoint:

```http
POST https://merchant.example.com/oauth2/token
Authorization: Basic <base64(client_id:client_secret)>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code
&code=<auth-code>
&redirect_uri=https://agent.example.com/callback
&code_verifier=<verifier>
```

Business validates `code_verifier` against stored `code_challenge`, returns:

```json
{
  "access_token": "<token>",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "<refresh>",
  "scope": "dev.ucp.shopping.order:read dev.ucp.shopping.order:manage"
}
```

Platform now includes `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on subsequent requests
to user-authenticated capability endpoints.
